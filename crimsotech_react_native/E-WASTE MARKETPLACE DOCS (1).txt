CHAPTER 1 - PRODUCT OVERVIEW

1.1.  PRODUCT OVERVIEW
       Many households retain old or malfunctioning electronic devices due to uncertainty regarding appropriate disposal methods. As a result, these items are frequently stockpiled or discarded improperly, contributing to the escalating problem of electronic waste (e-waste). In response to this issue, the present project proposes the development of a web-based marketplace designed to facilitate the exchange of non-functional or partially functional electronic devices.
       Through this platform, individuals can connect with buyers such as repair shops, recyclers, and electronics restoration services. These buyers can then reuse parts, recycle materials, or give the devices a new purpose. The system is designed to create a safe and organized space for e-waste transactions, making it easier for people to dispose of electronics responsibly while also promoting sustainability.
       By giving households a convenient way to clear out unused gadgets and providing buyers with affordable access to parts and materials, the platform helps reduce the amount of e-waste that ends up being discarded improperly. At the same time, it supports the idea of a circular economy that focusing on reuse, resource efficiency, and minimizing waste.
       
1.2. PROJECT SITE
       The project site serves as the central digital platform through which all interactions related to electronic waste exchange are conducted. It is designed to facilitate the listing, browsing, purchasing, and management of non-functional or partially functional electronic devices. The site provides a structured environment where individual sellers can post electronic items for sale, and authorized buyers such as repair shops, recyclers, and electronics restoration services can acquire these items for component recovery, recycling, or repurposing.
       
       The platform emphasizes user-friendliness, reliability, and scalability in its design. It supports various user roles with tailored access and functions, such as listing management for sellers, inventory and transaction tracking for buyers, and administrative tools for oversight. To further enhance efficiency, the system also integrates features like search optimization, transaction processing, and user feedback mechanisms, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience."

1.3 BACKGROUND OF THE CLIENT
       The client for this project comprises individuals and organizations that generate, collect, or process electronic waste. These include households that often accumulate unused or malfunctioning electronic devices, small businesses that dispose of outdated equipment, and local recycling or repair centers seeking accessible sources of recoverable components. Despite the increasing volume of discarded electronics, most households and institutions lack structured systems for proper disposal, leading to the storage of idle devices or their inappropriate disposal.
       
       The absence of an organized mechanism to connect sellers of non-functional electronics with potential buyers, such as repair shops, recyclers, and component recovery entities, results in wasted resources and contributes to environmental concerns. The proposed platform seeks to address this gap by providing a structured and user-friendly system that facilitates transactions, encourages sustainable practices, and promotes accountability in electronic waste management.
       
1.4. PROPOSED SOLUTION
       To address the growing issue of improperly managed electronic waste, this project proposes the development of a web-based marketplace that connects individuals who own non-functional or unused electronic devices with certified buyers such as repair shops, recyclers, and parts recovery businesses.
       The platform will serve as a centralized and user-friendly system where sellers can list their devices and buyers can easily browse, purchase, and manage acquisitions. It will be designed with features such as role-specific access, transaction monitoring, search optimization, and feedback mechanisms to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.
       By providing a structured digital space for responsible e-waste exchange, the system not only offers households a convenient way to dispose of unused electronics but also supplies buyers with affordable sources of parts and materials. Ultimately, the platform encourages sustainable practices, reduces electronic waste accumulation, and supports the principles of a circular economy.
       
1.4.1. PRODUCT SUMMARY
       The proposed system is a web-based marketplace aimed at addressing the challenges associated with the improper disposal and accumulation of electronic waste. It provides a structured platform where individuals can sell non-functional or obsolete electronic devices to accredited entities such as repair shops, recycling centers, and component recovery businesses.
       
       The system is designed with emphasis on user-friendliness, reliability, and scalability. Core functionalities include product listing, inventory browsing, transaction monitoring, and user feedback integration, all of which support efficient and transparent exchanges. For sellers, the platform offers an accessible means of responsibly disposing of unused devices, while buyers gain a cost-effective source of reusable parts and raw materials.
       
       By creating a direct link between households retaining unused electronics and organizations capable of reuse or recycling, the system fosters sustainable e-waste management practices and contributes to advancing the principles of the circular economy.

CHAPTER 5 - REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING
5.1. METHODOLOGY
       The team adopted the Waterfall Model as the software development methodology for the proposed system. This traditional and structured approach follows a clear sequence of stages: planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next, ensuring that the development process is systematic and well-organized.
Planning Phase
       The planning phase focuses on defining the goals, scope, and direction of the system. The team begins by establishing the project's identity, including the system name, logo design, and overall theme. Research is conducted to understand how online marketplaces operate, particularly those that allow both buyers and sellers to interact within a single platform. The developers also analyze the challenges related to e-waste management to integrate sustainability into the system's concept. During this phase, key features such as user registration, item listing, AI recommendations, and boosting plans are identified. The project timeline, resource allocation, and role assignments are finalized to ensure an organized development process.
Analysis Phase
       The analysis phase involves gathering and studying all system requirements. The team evaluates the specific needs of users such as buyers, sellers, and administrators. A SWOT analysis is performed to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the proposed system. The goal of this stage is to ensure that the platform meets real user demands while addressing potential limitations like scalability and security. The findings from user interviews, surveys, and existing market studies are used to refine the system requirements and form the foundation for design decisions.
Design Phase
       The design phase focuses on creating the structure and layout of the system. The team develops wireframes and mockups for the buyer, seller, and admin interfaces. These designs include essential features such as product search, filtering options, transaction history, and the feedback system. The database schema is constructed to efficiently store and retrieve user, product, and transaction data. Entity-Relationship Diagrams and system flowcharts are created to represent the logical flow of data. The system is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it performs well on both web and mobile platforms. The finalized designs are reviewed and validated before proceeding to implementation.
Implementation Phase
       During the implementation phase, the actual coding and system integration take place. The backend is developed using Django for the REST API, ensuring secure data management and communication between the frontend and database. The frontend, built with React and React Router, focuses on providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. Key features such as product listing, shopping cart, checkout process, and AI-based recommendations are developed. Sellers can manage their listings, track transactions, and use boosting plans to promote their products. The admin dashboard is implemented to monitor activities, manage users, and maintain platform integrity. Continuous code reviews and optimizations are done to maintain performance and scalability.


Testing Phase
       The testing phase ensures that the system functions properly and meets user expectations. Unit testing is conducted to verify that each component performs correctly. Integration testing follows to confirm that all modules work together seamlessly. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is performed to gather feedback from actual users, helping the team identify areas for improvement. The system is also tested across different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. Security testing is included to protect user data, transactions, and authentication processes. Any detected bugs or inconsistencies are resolved before deployment.
Deployment Phase
       In the deployment phase, the system is moved to the live environment using Heroku for backend hosting and Vercel for frontend deployment. The team monitors performance, resolves any post-deployment issues, and ensures that all components function smoothly. Users, including buyers and sellers, are oriented on how to navigate and use the platform effectively. Documentation is provided for both administrators and end users to support easy adoption.
Maintenance Phase
       After deployment, the maintenance phase ensures the long-term stability and improvement of the system. Regular updates are scheduled to enhance features, improve security, and fix issues that may arise. User feedback is continuously collected and analyzed to guide future updates. This phase focuses on keeping the system reliable, efficient, and aligned with user needs and technological advancements.
5.2.  CLIENT, CUSTOMERS AND STAKEHOLDERS
       In developing the E-Waste Marketplace, several groups directly benefit from the system or have been involved in its creation. Each has a significant role in ensuring that the system is useful and reliable, befitting its purpose of promoting responsible electronic waste disposal.
Client
       The clients of this project are individuals and small organizations that require a better way of disposing of old, broken, or unused electronic devices. As explained in earlier chapters of the document, many households and small businesses retain outdated electronics because there are no appropriate channels through which to dispose of them. The system would thus provide them with a secure, organized online platform where they can place these items and get in contact with interested buyers-for instance, repair shops or recyclers.
Customers / End-Users
Sellers
       The sellers are individuals or small groups that would like to dispose of their electronic devices that are already nonfunctional or outdated. They rely on the platform for uploading photos, adding descriptions of the items, and managing posts. For them, the system offers convenience and a responsible method of clearing out unused gadgets.
Buyers
       These buyers are repair shops, recyclers, restoration services, and anyone looking to acquire electronic components or scrap materials. They can use the system to browse listings, search for exactly what they need, compare options, and buy what they want. This provides direct access to a source of parts and materials at an affordable price.

Administrators
       Admins are responsible for the management of the whole platform. According to the feature list in your document, admins manage user accounts, listings, promotions, and the security and neatness of the site. They ensure trust between buyers and sellers.
Other Stakeholders
Crimsonity Development Team
       The student development team for the project, Crimsonity, serves as both the developers and maintainers of the system. Planning, design, coding, testing, documentation, and deployment have been handled by them, as depicted throughout the project plan in this document.

Instructors / Academic Supervisors
       The academic supervisors of the said project are Mr. Rhamirl Jaafar and Ms. Marjorie Rojas, as indicated in your document. They provide guidance, evaluate the progress, and make sure that the system is up to the standards of Software Engineering 1.

Recyclers and Repair Centers
       Recyclers and repair centers do more than just buy old electronics. They take what others throw away and turn it into something useful again-maybe by salvaging parts, recycling materials, or fixing broken gadgets. Their work really pushes the whole project forward. They help people get rid of e-waste the right way and keep those sustainability goals from Chapter 1 moving in the right direction.

Indirect Beneficiaries
       Some folks benefit from the platform without ever logging in or using it themselves. People in the community who care about the environment get something out of it too. The system pushes everyone toward better waste disposal habits and cuts down on electronic junk piling up where it shouldn't. Even if they're not active users, they still see the difference.
       
5.3.  PROJECT CONSTRAINTS
5.3.1. Development Environment
       The backend uses Django for secure and scalable development, while the frontend uses React Native for a responsive user interface. Development takes place on the local machine with the help of VS Code, npm/pip for package management, and Git for version control. User accounts and item listing data can be stored in the local PostgreSQL or MySQL database. Virtual environments are also applied to manage the dependencies of the project.

5.3.1.3. NETWORK COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS
       A reliable internet connection is necessary for the platform, with a minimum server speed of 10 Mbps and a minimum client speed of 5 Mbps. For safe and dependable data communication, it will employ TCP/IP and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. To avoid illegal access or data breaches, SSL/TLS encryption is required for all communications. The server needs to be available around-the-clock and able to manage several connections at once without experiencing any lag. Using a CDN to expedite content delivery and putting in place firewalls or network monitoring to preserve security and performance are examples of optional improvements.
       
5.3.2. IMPLEMENTATION ENVIRONMENT
	The E-Waste Marketplace platform is developed using a web-based architecture that supports scalability, cross-platform accessibility, and streamlined deployment. The system operates through client-server communication, leveraging cloud technologies for data management and secure transactions.
       5.3.2.1. SOFTWARE CONSTRAINTS
       There are a few software-related limitations that will help in the development of the E-Waste Marketplace. The system depends on certain tools, frameworks, and platforms, bringing with themselves a certain level of restriction. The back-end depends on Django, which needs to structure a project and supports only Python-based libraries. In the case of front-end development, it is based on React, which keeps the interface component-based architecture and dependent on browser compatibility. Database maintenance is done on MySQL, so database design has to follow relational database rules and SQL standards.
       Hosting platforms come with their own set of rules. Take Heroku, for example. When you use it for backend deployment, you run into caps on storage, runtime hours, and how much you can scale your servers-especially if you stick with the free or basic plans. Vercel handles the frontend pretty well and makes deploying fast, but you bump into file size restrictions, limits on bandwidth, and not much room for backend processing since it's really built for static and serverless front-end projects. So, these software limits end up shaping how you build the system and decide which features actually make sense to add.
       5.3.2.2.  HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS
       The project also faces certain hardware-related limitations: on the server side and during development. The system relies, for hosting, on the resources made available by Heroku and Vercel. These servers have a certain limitation in their processing power, storage capacity, and memory allocation, thus affecting how many transactions the system can handle at once.
       On the development side, the team is limited by the capabilities of their own machines. Since this project needs to run backend services, frontend builds, databases, and testing tools, slower or lower-spec laptops may affect development speed and testing performance. Storage limitations affect how many images and logs can be kept locally. Plus, since users will be uploading product images, the system needs to handle file sizes to avoid overloading server storage and preventing performance issues.
5.3.2.3. DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINTS
       Deployment of the system introduces a variety of practical constraints. The hosting platforms chosen, with Heroku for the backend and Vercel for the frontend, impose bandwidth and uptime limits, including a maximum number of requests handled without additional fees, especially on free or entry plans. The dependency on an active Internet connection means that any disruption caused by the host or unstable user access to the Internet disrupts platform use. Another driving factor is the security requirements. The system should operate over HTTPS, which introduces an extra layer of security in data transfer. This is necessary under all conditions to safeguard user information and login credentials. Patches and maintenance are strictly allowed only within the deployment windows, during which parts of the system can be unavailable for short lengths of time. Such constraints, therefore, guide the team in handling updates, user access, and overall stability of the platform.
5.4. SCOPE OF THE PRODUCT
       It is an online marketplace that will deal in all types of electronic wastes. To be simple, the system connects non-functional or obsolete electronic devices in households or from individuals to certified buyers such as repair shops, recyclers, and parts recovery businesses. The proposed system will offer listing, browsing, buying, and managing electronic devices in a secure environment, which shall be well-organized and user-friendly.
       The platform supports role-based access:
? Allows sellers to create accounts, list electronic items, upload descriptions and images, track their items, and promote listings.
? Buyers can browse the inventory and filter or search for devices, add items to a cart, complete secure transactions, and even receive AI-based recommendations.
? The administrative dashboard provides administrators with oversight over all user activities, transactions, and e-waste reporting.
       The system has additional features such as feedback and ratings, analytics and reporting, transaction monitoring, and shop promotion, which ensure transparency, efficiency, and accountability.
       Boundaries of the System:
? The system does not provide physical collection or delivery services, and it strictly acts as an online marketplace for buyers and sellers.
? It focuses on non-functional or partially functional electronics, and is not designed for the sales of fully functional products.
? The platform manages all financial transactions, but the actual processing depends on integrated external payment gateways.
       
       Intended Impact: By streamlining the process for exchanging e-waste, it fosters responsibility in the area of disposal, reutilization, and sustainability, thus minimizing incorrect accumulations of electronic waste and upholding a circular economy.

5.7. PROJECT ISSUES
	During development and implementation, there are a number of problems the system may face. Others need further research, such as AI recommendations and the integration of payment gateways. There may be technical challenges, including bugs, security concerns, or performance limitations as the user base grows. Additionally, user adoption and accurate item listings could affect the platform's reliability. These issues will be monitored and addressed as the project progresses.

5.7.1. OPEN ISSUES
	There are certain aspects of the system that need further clarification and refinement. Major features that might need further configuration before acting as expected include the AI-based recommendation system and the promotion/boosting module. Most importantly, transaction handling-issues regarding security and verification-are still under review. Some open questions also remain regarding the capability of the platform to handle a large number of listings and users when a spike in usage occurs. These will be resolved during the course of development.

5.7.2. OFF-THE-SHELL SOLUTIONS
	Online marketplaces and recycling management tools already provide some similar functionalities. However, almost all e-commerce systems available in the market are designed for general buying and selling without a focus on electronic waste reuse or recovery. On the other hand, specific recycling systems usually track waste but do not support buyer-seller marketplace interactions. As no available ready-made solution fully supports e-waste trading with sustainability-focused features and role-based access for recyclers and repair shops, a custom system is required.

5.7.3. RISK
	These are some of the risks of this project. Technical risks pertain to the complexity in implementing recommendations proposed by machine learning and supporting stable, predictable system performance. Security risks may be due to unauthorized access, fraud in the nature of listings, and data breaches. Operational risks pertain to incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of items posted by users. There is also a user adoption risk as this is a new platform, which takes substantial time to get active sellers and buyers on board. Management and monitoring will be required throughout the development cycle.

5.7.4. WAITING ROOM
	The waiting room also includes features and improvements that will be in future phases but are not within the scope of this current development. This can include a dedicated mobile application, integrated logistic or pickup services, automated pricing tools, third-party payment gateways, enhanced reporting tools, and multi-language support. These shall be considered once the core system is stable and fully operational.
